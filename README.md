## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Input an IP, be warned if the inputted IP is invalid
- If it is valid, the map should move to the specfied IP address
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io//)
- [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [IP API](https://ipapi.co/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

This project was used as continued practice of mobile first development. I also wanted to practice with API use in Angular as well as practice using TailwindCSS

### Continued development

I find that the components in Angular is very useful however Angular still has some difficulties importing things from the assets folder directly into the typescript. The keywords offered by Angular in the HTML is also simple and very powerful. I want to continue building great looking sites but hopefully with more interactability!

### Useful resources

- [Build Maps in Angular with Leaflet](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/angular-angular-and-leaflet) - This helped me for implementing Leaflet in Angular. It is very simple and easy to follow and understand.
